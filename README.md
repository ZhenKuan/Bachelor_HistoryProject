# HistoryProject
- I've participate some projects during my years in the university.
- Since I am just starting to set up my portfolio recently, I've lost my code already, however, my result for some project are still saved as the form of videos, and the link are listed bellow.
## 1. [AirQualityIntelligentSensing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnx8poMDC9YPr49BTg2RB9gRO9hNxdRZ/view?usp=sharing)
> This is the main project I am working on with my partners in college, we accomplished a self-propelled car that may automatic create unknown spaces' 2D map, and simultaneously detect the PM2.5 data according to different areas, furthermore, make priorly improvements against the worse air quality area. 
>> I am mainly responsible for the tech of using the Rplidar, which is based on the SLAM technology, to create a 2D map in any unknown space.
## 2. [FPGAClockDesign](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DF6MYyo6Qt-xA5MYnypatDZ69QQvUU0v/view?usp=sharing)
> The link upon is the report, which contains the main code of the project using verilog. 
## 3. [GyroControlledSelfPropelledCar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15QZ_TeQ5waM1vnYl1dHeycSbmKgJCb3n/view?usp=sharing)
## 4. [AutomaticParking](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0W3-hL8coeywjIYgLPUuJGoiGfgPRE5/view?usp=sharing)
> 3. and 4. is a small project my friend and I accomplised during space time.
## 5. [CopyTheBellSignal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IOyGmWG7nNHuQQAtKCC7LVyelMtgBcA/view?usp=sharing)
## 6. [PLCIndustryUniversityCooperation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12lNS9v_xETSaUjBllMcOCVX1baW4xLXR/view?usp=sharing)
> The main purpose of this project is to use the sensor to detect the offset angle of the copper plate and show the result on matlab.

> What's more, due to the cooperation with the Symtek Automation Asia Coporation, we also have some experience using PLC to control the sensor.
## 7. [TheElectricPowerSavingProject](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pzbCzqMfGy2QFAYBpwGXnjmrdycYk00L/view?usp=sharing)
> The project is cooperatedd with I-Link Community Services Association( Taiwan), our mission is to find out methods in order to decrease the electricity bill of their office building.
